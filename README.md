# Condensate_BD_Sim
Brownian dynamics simulation of simple system capable of condensate formation. Droplet-forming particles experience attraction at short distances, allowing them to form stable condensates at sufficiently high concentrations. A polymer comprising non-interactive sections and interactive sections that attract the droplet-forming particles can be added. This polymer (or surface) can lead to surface-condensation below the critical concentration for classical phase separation. The presence of condensates or droplets is determined by DB-scan (distance=40nm, min_samples=10).
Implementation in python using ReaDDy for particle dynamics.
